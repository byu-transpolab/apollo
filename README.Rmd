This is a fork of `Apollo` by Stephane Hess and David Palma. More information is
available at their [website](http://www.apollochoicemodelling.com/)

This fork includes edits and convenience functions that I am using in my own work. This is not --- and should not be seen as --- the official Apollo repository. It is likely that this fork could become outdated relative to official Apollo.

## Installation

You can install the released version of apollo from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("apollo")
```

You can install this fork of the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("byu-transpolab/apollo")
```
## Example

Examples are also on the [website](http://www.apollochoicemodelling.com/)
